    '**The 7 most common objections and exact scripts to overcome them:**',
    '',
    '**OBJECTION #1:** "That\'s too expensive"',
    '→ "I understand. Let me ask - what are you currently spending on ads per month? [Let them answer] Right. So $800 to create the ads that make that $5,000 work better is less than 20% of your budget. Most successful businesses invest 15-20% of ad spend on creative."',
    '',
    '**OBJECTION #2:** "We can do this ourselves with Canva"',
    '→ "You absolutely could! The question is: do you have 10-15 hours per month to create 20 professional ads? Because that\'s what it takes. Most business owners find their time is better spent running the business, not designing ads."',
    '',
    '**OBJECTION #3:** "How do I know the ads will work?"',
    '→ "Great question. I don\'t guarantee results - because I\'m not running the ads, you are. What I guarantee is professional, conversion-optimized creative based on proven frameworks. The ads I create use the same psychology and formats that major brands spend millions testing."',
    '',
    '**OBJECTION #4:** "We need to think about it"',
    '→ "Totally fair. What specifically do you need to think about? Is it the price, the process, or something else? [Let them answer] I can address that right now if you\'d like."',
    '',
    '**OBJECTION #5:** "We\'re not ready to start yet"',
    '→ "No problem! When were you thinking? [Let them answer] Great, I\'ll follow up with you in [timeframe minus one week]. In the meantime, here\'s my direct contact info. And hey - I\'ll throw in 5 bonus ads your first month if you sign up in the next two weeks."',
    '',
    '**OBJECTION #6:** "Can you guarantee ROI?"',
    '→ "I wish I could, but honestly, ROI depends on your offer, pricing, targeting, and dozens of factors I don\'t control. What I CAN guarantee is that you\'ll get professional ad creatives that follow proven conversion frameworks. Better creatives = better chances of success."',
    '',
    '**OBJECTION #7:** "We\'re already working with an agency"',
    '→ "That\'s great! Are you getting unlimited ad variations from them? Most agencies create 5-10 ads per month. With Meta\'s new algorithm, you need 30-50 variations to stay competitive. I can supplement what your agency is doing for a fraction of their cost."',
