**The 15-minute call that closes deals:**

**STRUCTURE:**
1. **Rapport building (2 min):** Small talk, show you looked at their business
2. **Understanding their needs (5 min):** Ask questions about their current marketing
3. **Presenting your solution (5 min):** Show samples, explain your service
4. **Handling objections (2 min):** Address concerns (price, process, guarantees)
5. **Closing (1 min):** "Want to move forward?"

**KEY QUESTIONS TO ASK:**
- "Are you currently running Facebook ads?"
- "How often do you need new ad creatives?"
- "What's been your biggest challenge with ad creative?"
- "What's your monthly ad budget?" (helps you price appropriately)
- "If we could deliver 20 professional ads per month, what would that be worth to you?"

### Lesson 5.2: Presenting Your Service (15 min)
**The offer that makes them say yes:**

**WHAT YOU'RE SELLING:**
"Done-for-you Facebook ad creative service"

**WHAT'S INCLUDED:**
- 20 professional ad creatives per month
- Images + copy (ready to upload)
- Multiple variations for A/B testing
- All Facebook formats (Feed, Stories, Reels)
- 24-48 hour turnaround
- Unlimited revisions (within reason)

**PRICING OPTIONS:**

**PAYMENT TERMS:**

- Auto-renew monthly (Stripe subscription)
- Cancel anytime (builds trust)

### Lesson 5.3: Pricing Psychology (12 min)
**How to price confidently without leaving money on the table:**

**FACTORS THAT AFFECT PRICING:**
- **Client size:** Larger businesses = higher budget
- **Geographic location:** NYC/LA vs. small town
- **Industry:** Real estate and medical typically pay more
- **Current ad spend:** If they're spending $5K/month on ads, $800/month for creatives is nothing

**TIERED PRICING STRATEGY:**
- Always present 3 options (people rarely pick the cheapest)
- Make the middle option the "best value"
- The premium option makes the middle option look reasonable

**ANCHORING TECHNIQUE:**
"Most agencies charge $3,000-5,000/month for this service. I can do it for $800 because I'm solo and use AI to be efficient."

### Lesson 5.4: Objection Handling Scripts (18 min)
**The 7 most common objections and exact scripts to overcome them:**

**OBJECTION #1:** "That's too expensive"
→ "I understand. Let me ask - what are you currently spending on ads per month? [Let them answer] Right. So $800 to create the ads that make that $5,000 work better is less than 20% of your budget. Most successful businesses invest 15-20% of ad spend on creative."

**OBJECTION #2:** "We can do this ourselves with Canva"
→ "You absolutely could! The question is: do you have 10-15 hours per month to create 20 professional ads? Because that's what it takes. Most business owners find their time is better spent running the business, not designing ads."

**OBJECTION #3:** "How do I know the ads will work?"
→ "Great question. I don't guarantee results - because I'm not running the ads, you are. What I guarantee is professional, conversion-optimized creative based on proven frameworks. The ads I create use the same psychology and formats that major brands spend millions testing."

**OBJECTION #4:** "We need to think about it"
→ "Totally fair. What specifically do you need to think about? Is it the price, the process, or something else? [Let them answer] I can address that right now if you'd like."

**OBJECTION #5:** "We're not ready to start yet"
→ "No problem! When were you thinking? [Let them answer] Great, I'll follow up with you in [timeframe minus one week]. In the meantime, here's my direct contact info. And hey - I'll throw in 5 bonus ads your first month if you sign up in the next two weeks."

**OBJECTION #6:** "Can you guarantee ROI?"
→ "I wish I could, but honestly, ROI depends on your offer, pricing, targeting, and dozens of factors I don't control. What I CAN guarantee is that you'll get professional ad creatives that follow proven conversion frameworks. Better creatives = better chances of success."

**OBJECTION #7:** "We're already working with an agency"
→ "That's great! Are you getting unlimited ad variations from them? Most agencies create 5-10 ads per month. With Meta's new algorithm, you need 30-50 variations to stay competitive. I can supplement what your agency is doing for a fraction of their cost."

### Lesson 8.2: Performance-Based Pricing (Advanced) (15 min)
**RISK-REVERSAL STRATEGY:**
Instead of flat monthly fee, offer:
- Low monthly retainer ($200) + % of ad spend (3-5%)
- OR low monthly retainer ($300) + % of revenue generated

**EXAMPLE:**
"I'll charge you $300/month + 4% of your ad spend. If you're spending $5,000/month on ads, that's $200 more = $500 total. But if your ad spend grows to $10,000, I make $700 total because I helped you scale."

**PROS:**
- Easier to close clients (lower upfront risk)
- Potentially higher earnings long-term
- Incentive alignment (you win when they win)

**CONS:**
- You need access to their ad account (trust issue)
- More complex billing
- Income less predictable

**WHEN TO USE THIS:**
- Large clients with big budgets
- You have proven results
- They're hesitant about flat fees

### Lesson 8.3: White-Label Partnerships (18 min)
**SELLING YOUR SERVICE TO AGENCIES:**
- Many small marketing agencies need ad creative but can't afford designers
- You become their "secret weapon"
- They charge clients $2,000/month, pay you $600/month, keep $1,400
- You focus on creation, they handle client management

**HOW TO FIND AGENCY PARTNERS:**
- Search LinkedIn: "Digital marketing agency [city]"
- Look for agencies with 2-10 employees (not one person, not mega agency)
- Reach out: "Do you ever need additional ad creative capacity for clients?"

**WHITE-LABEL PRICING:**
- **Per-project:** $300-500 per client per month
- **Monthly retainer:** $2,000-3,000/month for unlimited clients
- **Revenue share:** 30-40% of what they charge clients

**BENEFITS:**
- Consistent volume (agencies have multiple clients)
- No client acquisition work needed
- Stable relationships (agencies don't churn like individual clients)

### Lesson 8.4: Building a Mini-Agency (15 min)
**WHEN YOU'RE READY TO GROW BEYOND SOLO:**

**HIRING YOUR FIRST TEAMMATE:**
- Who to hire first: VA for admin, then junior designer for overflow work
- Where to find: Dribbble, Behance, 99designs, Upwork
- What to pay: $15-30/hour depending on skill level
- How to train: Document your processes, use Loom videos

**DELEGATING CREATION WORK:**
- You still use AdGenius AI, but VA helps with:
  - Client communication
  - File organization
  - Quality control
  - Scheduling
  - Follow-ups

**PROFIT MARGINS:**
- Solo: 95%+ profit ($800 client = $760 profit)
- With VA ($8/hour, 10 hours/month): 90% profit ($800 client = $720 profit)
- Still incredibly profitable while buying back your time

**THE MINI-AGENCY MODEL:**
- 30 clients × $800 = $24,000/month revenue
- 2 VAs handling admin + organization = $3,000/month
- Your time: 20 hours/week (oversight + creation + sales)
- Profit: ~$20,000/month

## BONUS MODULE 3: TROUBLESHOOTING & FAQ (30 minutes)

**Common problems and solutions:**

### FAQ 3.1: "I'm not getting any responses to my outreach" (8 min)
**POSSIBLE ISSUES:**
- Your subject lines are too generic
- You're not personalizing enough
- You're not including samples
- You're reaching out to the wrong prospects
- Your emails are going to spam

**SOLUTIONS:**
- Test different subject lines
- Spend 2 minutes researching each prospect before emailing
- Always attach 3-5 custom samples
- Focus on businesses actively running ads
- Use a warm-up service for your email (Mailwarm, Lemwarm)

### FAQ 3.2: "Clients are asking for revisions beyond scope" (6 min)
**SOLUTION:**
- Set clear revision policy upfront: "2 rounds of revisions included"
- After that, charge: "$50 per additional revision" or "Unlimited revisions for +$100/month"
- Be firm but professional: "Happy to make these changes! That would be outside our agreement, so I'd need to charge $X for the additional work."

### FAQ 3.3: "A client isn't paying on time" (5 min)
**SOLUTION:**
- Automated billing prevents this (Stripe auto-charge)
- If manual: Send reminder 3 days before due date
- If late: Pause service until paid
- Professional message: "Hi [Name], just noticed the payment for this month didn't go through. I've paused your account until we get that sorted. Let me know if you need help!"

### FAQ 3.4: "Client wants to cancel" (8 min)
**SOLUTION:**
- Ask why: "Can I ask what prompted this decision?"
- Common reasons: Budget, not seeing results, found someone cheaper
- Offer solution: Lower tier, payment plan, discount, pause instead of cancel
- Exit gracefully: "I understand. No problem! If anything changes in the future, feel free to reach out."
- Ask for referral: "Before you go, do you know anyone who might benefit from this service?"

### FAQ 3.5: "I'm stuck at 5 clients and can't scale" (3 min)
**POSSIBLE ISSUES:**
- Not spending enough time on outreach
- Outreach methods not working
- Positioning issue (price too high, service unclear)

**SOLUTIONS:**
